# CAVE_Weather
A project made for CAVE VR environments, designed with Unity and MiddleVR.

This project was created with the intention of demonstrating the utility of CAVEs as an education tool, and has been ported from Plastic SCM, the version control system which was used during development.

The project itself is a 3d creation of a synoptic meteorological scenario (specifically a mid latitude cyclone) which is difficult to understand through the limited medium of powerpoint slides and images. The 3d environment outlining the weather event provides a far superior way to visualize the content and allows instructors and students to share the learning experience together simultaneously.
